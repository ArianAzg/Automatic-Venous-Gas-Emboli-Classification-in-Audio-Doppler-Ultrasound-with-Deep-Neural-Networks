# Automatic-Venous-Gas-Emboli-Classification-with-Deep-Neural-Networks

A novel deep learning model has been developed to classify the Venous Gas Emboli (VGE) grade in Doppler ultrasound audio recordings. To date, this is the first attempt to incorporate deep learning model into VGE detection and classification in audio Doppler ultrasound.
